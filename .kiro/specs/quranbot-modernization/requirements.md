# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the modernization and improvement of the QuranBot Discord application. The project aims to transform the existing codebase into a more maintainable, secure, and performant application while preserving all core Islamic functionality. The modernization will focus on adopting current Python best practices, improving code quality, enhancing security, and removing unnecessary web dashboard components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining QuranBot, I want the codebase to use modern Python practices and dependency management, so that the project is easier to maintain and deploy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is updated THEN it SHALL use Python 3.11+ as the minimum version
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the project SHALL use Poetry instead of requirements.txt
3. WHEN writing code THEN all modules SHALL include proper type hints using modern Python typing
4. WHEN handling asynchronous operations THEN the code SHALL use consistent async/await patterns
5. WHEN packaging the project THEN it SHALL include proper pyproject.toml configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on QuranBot, I want comprehensive code quality tools and testing, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL be automatically formatted using Black
2. WHEN code is committed THEN it SHALL pass linting checks using Ruff
3. WHEN running tests THEN the project SHALL have at least 80% test coverage
4. WHEN testing critical workflows THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end functionality
5. WHEN errors occur THEN custom exception classes SHALL provide clear error context
6. WHEN code is analyzed THEN type checking with mypy SHALL pass without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying QuranBot, I want the application to be secure and follow security best practices, so that the bot and server are protected from vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the bot THEN sensitive data SHALL be loaded from environment variables only
2. WHEN users interact with commands THEN rate limiting SHALL prevent abuse
3. WHEN processing user input THEN all inputs SHALL be validated and sanitized
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN proper Discord permission checks SHALL be enforced
5. WHEN logging sensitive information THEN it SHALL be properly masked or excluded
6. WHEN the bot starts THEN it SHALL validate all required permissions and configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of QuranBot, I want the bot to respond quickly and efficiently, so that my Islamic learning and listening experience is smooth and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN it SHALL be served from an in-memory cache
2. WHEN audio files are loaded THEN they SHALL use lazy loading to reduce startup time
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use connection pooling for efficiency
4. WHEN the bot shuts down THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN metrics SHALL be collected for optimization insights
6. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the bot SHALL maintain responsive performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending QuranBot functionality, I want the codebase to follow modern architectural patterns, so that new features can be added easily and maintainably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need dependencies THEN a dependency injection container SHALL manage them
2. WHEN logging events THEN structured logging SHALL provide consistent, searchable output
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN health check endpoints SHALL report component status
4. WHEN validating data THEN Pydantic models SHALL ensure type safety and validation
5. WHEN organizing code THEN clear separation of concerns SHALL be maintained
6. WHEN handling configuration THEN a centralized configuration management system SHALL be used

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to remove the web dashboard components cleanly, so that the project focuses solely on Discord bot functionality without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing web components THEN the web/ directory SHALL be completely removed
2. WHEN cleaning dependencies THEN Flask and web-related packages SHALL be removed from requirements
3. WHEN updating documentation THEN all web dashboard references SHALL be removed
4. WHEN modifying configuration THEN web-related environment variables SHALL be removed
5. WHEN updating the main application THEN web dashboard initialization code SHALL be removed
6. WHEN testing the removal THEN the bot SHALL function normally without web components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer debugging QuranBot issues, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN errors happen THEN they SHALL include full context and stack traces
3. WHEN monitoring the bot THEN health metrics SHALL be available for system status
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN detailed timing information SHALL be logged
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN log correlation IDs SHALL connect related events
6. WHEN rotating logs THEN old logs SHALL be archived automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want simplified deployment and configuration management, so that the bot can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the bot THEN a single configuration file SHALL manage all settings
2. WHEN running in different environments THEN environment-specific configurations SHALL be supported
3. WHEN starting the bot THEN configuration validation SHALL prevent startup with invalid settings
4. WHEN updating configuration THEN changes SHALL be applied without requiring code changes
5. WHEN managing secrets THEN they SHALL be handled securely through environment variables
6. WHEN documenting deployment THEN clear setup instructions SHALL be provided
